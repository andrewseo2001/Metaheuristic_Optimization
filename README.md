# Optimizing Robotic Movements for Efficient Sensor Calibration

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance sensor-fusion calibration in robotics through metaheuristic optimization techniques, focusing on a robotic arm's movements.

## Methodology
We employed three key strategies:
- **Genetic Mutation with Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**
- **Annealing Search**
- **Parent Selection with VNS**
These were evaluated based on their effectiveness in minimizing re-projection error and total calibration time.

## Results
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the Modified Local Search (MLS) algorithm, demonstrating substantial improvements in robotic calibration techniques.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates the vast potential of metaheuristic optimization in real-world applications. Our research not only achieves a more efficient sensor calibration process, but also opens new avenues for future implementations and modifications. The successful application of the Modified Local Search (MLS) algorithm shows the importance of innovative approaches in tackling complex engineering challenges and testing benchmarks for precision and efficiency in robotic systems.
